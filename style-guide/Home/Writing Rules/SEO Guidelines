These guidelines ensure that all Frontdesko blog content is clear, consistent, search-friendly, and useful for small hotel owners.

Our goal is to write **helpful, simple, easy-to-read content** that solves real hotel problems while improving visibility on search engines.

## Goal of Our Blogs

Our blogs should:

- Educate small hotel owners and staff  
- Build trust  
- Bring organic traffic  
- Convert readers into demo sign-ups  

**Tone should be:** Simple, helpful, friendly, jargon-free  
- **Jargon:** “API connectivity”  
  **Simple:** “The software can link with other apps”

---

## Keyword Selection

**Suggested Tools:** Ubersuggest, Google Keyword Planner


Choose keywords that are:

- Relevant to Frontdesko (hotel software, PMS, check-in, billing, etc.)  
- Have good search volume  
- Match what our target users actually search  

No need to check:

- SEO difficulty  
- Keyword density  
- Competition metrics *(These matter later, not now.)*  

**Long-tail keywords are preferred** (longer, more specific search phrases).

**Examples:**

- “hotel management software for small hotels” → not “hotel software”  
- “simple hotel PMS” → not “PMS”

---

## Keyword Grouping (Important)

- Collect similar or related keywords into one cluster/topic instead of treating each keyword separately.  
- For example, keywords like **“hotel management software”**, **“hotel management system”**, **“HMS for hotels”** belong to one group.

**Benefits:**

- Avoids duplicate or overlapping content  
- Helps improve ranking  
- Allows you to create one strong, detailed blog  
- Prevents keyword cannibalization (multiple pages competing against each other)

---

## Blog Structure Guidelines

### **H1 – Title** (Only 1 per blog)  
Example: *What is a Hotel Management System? Why Small Hotels Need It.*

### **H2 – Main Sections (2–4 max)**  
Examples:
- What is an HMS?  
- Why hotels struggle with manual management  
- Benefits of using HMS  

### **H3 – Subsections under H2**  
Examples:
- Faster check-in  
- Easy billing  
- Error-free bookings  

**No need for H4.** (Keep it simple.)

### **FAQs**   
  - Source ideas from Google **“People Also Ask”** or common hotelier questions  

### **Conclusion (optional) + CTA**  
“*Want to simplify your hotel operations? Book a demo with Frontdesko.*”

## Writing Format

- Use short paragraphs (2–3 lines max)

**Quality > word count.**
